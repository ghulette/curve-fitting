Curve-fitting Demo
==================

This demo is based on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Section 1.1. 
To run it, execute 'run' from Matlab.  To change parameters, edit run.m.

M: This is the polynomial degree of the model.
N: The number of noisy observations to generate.
Ntest: The number of test points to predict.
